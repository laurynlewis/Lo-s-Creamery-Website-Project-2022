    <h1> The Story of Lo's Creamery</h1>
    
    <p>Lo’s Creamery was established in 2019 by Lauryn Lewis, aka “Lo” and Camron Knight. Lauryn took her status as a
        <em> self-professed </em>
         ice cream connoisseur and partnered with Camron, the business brains, to sell ice cream from a cart at the Dallas Farmers Market. Once word got around, the business was able to expand with flagship locations in Dallas and DC opening in early 2020 and late 2021. Since then, the business has expanded with an additional three locations, Indianapolis, Orlando, and Tampa set to open by Winter 2023.  </p>
<p> 
    Here at Lo’s Creamery we pride ourselves on churning out decadent ice cream, sorbet, and dairy-free options with imaginative flavor profiles, with customer favorites including rose water, sweet potato pie, and banana pudding.
